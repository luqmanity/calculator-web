            What is <meta>?
            - HTML Metadata is data about the HTML document
            - It is not displayed on the webpage

            Why is Metadata important?
            - Used by the browser to know how to display content, etc
            - Search Engines uses metadata for keywords and other services
            (SEO - Search Engine Optimisation, is how high a website will rank
            when it is searched on a search engine (Google, Bing, etc) based
            on relevancy, complicated but don't need to know that.)
